      <ContentText>
        Freshly graduated from the Department of Information Engineering, State
        Islamic University of Malang. I have an interest in many exciting things
        such as art, sports, food, movies, and I love to play with my big chatty
        black cat. I create faceless human illustrations, illustrations for
        website assets, flat illustrations, icons, and anything else that can be
        done with a pen tablet. I love writing code and and enjoy working with
        code, especially website development. Being an only child made me always
        interested in meeting new people, having new conversations about
        interesting things, and making friends.
